## Feature details

### [01] CREATE USER

- Prompts for **username** (0 = back, 00 = exit).
- You set **password**, **expiration date**, and **connection limit**.
- User is created with `useradd`, expiry with `chage`, limit stored in `/root/users.db`.
- After creation, IP, user, password, expiry, and limit are shown so you can copy them.

### [02] REMOVE USER

- Choose a user from the list and confirm to remove.
- Removes the user account and their entry from the limits/expiry data.

### [03] MONITOR USERS

- Table of users with: status (online/offline/expired/expiring), connections, session time, current/total traffic, validity (days), last connection, password.
- Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds. Press Enter to return to the menu.

### [04] EXPIRATION DATE

- Pick a user, then set a new expiration date (e.g. number of days or a date).
- Uses the same user list and 0/00 behavior as other user submenus.

### [05] ACCOUNT LIMIT

- Pick a user and set maximum simultaneous connections (e.g. 1, 2, 5).
- Stored in `/root/users.db` and used by the manager’s connection logic.

### [06] USER PASSWORD

- Pick a user and set a new password (via `chpasswd`).

### [07] EXPIRED USERS

- Lists users past their expiration date.
- Lets you remove them or clean up expired entries.

### [08] CONNECTIONS

- Opens the **Connections** submenu.
- From here you can open **SSH Multi-Port Setup** (add/remove SSH ports, quick multi-port setup, verify).  
  See [SSH Multi-Port Setup](SSH-MULTIPORT.md) for how it works and how it interacts with UFW.

### [09] SPEEDTEST

- Runs **speedtest-cli** and shows ping, download, and upload.
- If `speedtest-cli` is missing, the menu will try to install it (pip or apt) and show a short message. Press Enter to return.

### [10] BANNER

- Set the text shown before SSH login (e.g. “SSHPLUS MANAGER - IP: x.x.x.x”).
- Saved to `/etc/banner` and used by `sshd` via `Banner /etc/banner`.

### [11] VPS TRAFFIC

- Starts **nload** to show live network traffic. Exit with Ctrl+C.

### [12] BACKUP

- Backs up user/manager-related data (e.g. user list, limits) so you can restore later.

### [13] VPS INFO

- Shows hostname, CPU, RAM, disk, network, and similar system info.

### [14] REBOOT SYSTEM

- Reboots the server after confirmation.

### [15] RESTART SERVICES

- Restarts SSH (and any other managed services) so config changes take effect.

### [16] ROOT PASSWORD

- Changes the root password after you type it twice.

### [17] AUTO RUN

- Enables or disables running the menu automatically when you log in (via `/etc/profile`).

### [18] UPDATE SCRIPT

- Compares installed version with the repository.
- If newer, offers to download and replace menu and modules from the repo.  
  Repository URL is taken from `/etc/SSHPlus/repo_url` if set, otherwise the default GitHub URL.

### [19] REMOVE SCRIPT

- Uninstalls the manager: removes `/bin/menu`, modules, and related files after you confirm (including typing “DELETE”).
